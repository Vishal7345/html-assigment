Comments in HTML serve several purposes:

Documentation: They help document the code, making it easier for others (or yourself at a later time) to understand what the code does.

Debugging: Comments can be used to temporarily disable parts of the code without deleting them, which can be helpful during debugging.

Organization: They can be used to organize and divide the code into sections, making it more readable.
Comments in HTML are not displayed by the browser. They are purely for the benefit of anyone reading the code.
  in above example:
  The  is a single-line comment.
The  surrounding the multi-line text is a multi-line comment.
The commented-out <div> section demonstrates how you can disable a part of the code by commenting it out. This section won't be rendered by the browser.
